## Introduction  {#introduction}

[My worldview]({{ site.url }}/tech-support/foundations/presuppositions) colors
all areas of my thinking, certainly including about digital technology. Before
you accept any of my recommendations, I hope you understand the lens through
which I view the technologies for which I write.

## 1. Using digital technologies is an unavoidably moral act. {#unavoidably-moral}

God gives regenerate Bible believers one greatest commandment, one ultimate goal
-- to love and glorify God, really two sides of one coin (Isaiah 43:6-7; Ezekiel
36:22, 23, 32; Matthew 22:37; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Ephesians 1:5-6). We live
before the face of the only righteous Judge, and He evaluates whether
each of our acts is done in accord with this command (Matthew 12:36-37; Romans
14:12; Hebrews 4:13).

By implication, our lives and choices are inherently, unavoidably moral. We
either live with appropriate reference to God, or we live without it. Our
motives, thoughts, and deeds are either a pleasing aroma or a idolatrous stench.

This certainly includes our use of digital technology.

The world will tell you that digital technologies are neutral tools for which
the modes of usage (posting, swiping, speaking, hearing, etc.) are neutral, and
only the content that you encounter while in use can be right or wrong. For
example, "What harm or good can scrolling Twitter do? It's just a thing you can
do. Now, the things people post to Twitter, that's a different story."

This is wrong. Digital technology carries important moral decisions in every act
of usage. This list of moral implications is not exhaustive:

* It affects our stewardship of time.
* It affects how we perceive our relationships with others.
* It affects our communication skills.
* It affects our wallet and budgets.
* It affects how we place ourselves in society (intellect, status, etc.).
* It affects our purity.

If the stakes of each act of using a digital technology are as high as being
pleasing or offending to Almighty God, we should think carefully before and
while we use it, every time.

## 2. Digital technologies are tools to steward. {#tool-to-steward}

Everything we possess are gifts given by God for the purpose of enjoying Him
more and for stewarding and investing for His purposes. Further, He expects us
to produce a return on His investment (Matthew 25:14-30; Luke 12:42-46; 1
Corinthians 4:2; 1 Peter 4:10).

This certainly includes our use of digital technology.

The world will tell you that you should use any product or service of digital
technology if you desire to, in any way you desire to, and that everyone else is
doing the same thing. "If it's on the app store, it's okay to install it." "If
everyone else is watching it, you can too."

This is wrong. Digital technologies are tools to manipulate with intention.
Compare our mindset to analog tools like spatulas, hammers, and chainsaws:

* These tools are designed with specific uses in mind. E.g. a chainsaw is
  designed to cut things mor easily than an axe.
* These tools have proper and improper uses. E.g. a chainsaw can be used to
  clear a blocked road or to commit mass murder in a horror film.
* These tools require knowledge and awareness to use effectively. E.g. a
  chainsaw in the hands of a lumberjack performs much better than a chainsaw in
  *my* hands.

Imagine revving and swinging around a brand-new chainsaw, without knowing what
the switches do, how to turn it off, or who was around you. Imagine giving your
kid a chainsaw just because everyone else is doing it. Now, how much thought do
you give to using or sharing digital technology?

Do you know the specific uses that your technology was designed for? Do you know
how the technology producers make money from providing you a free service? Are
you aware of ways that your technology can be used improperly, especially before
you give them to kids?

We should learn about various digital technologies before we use them, with the
same care that we read the operation manual for our new chainsaw before the
first rev. We should always use caution and thoughtfulness when wielding these
tools. And before giving them to others, we should make sure they are equipped
with knowledge to use them well, too.

## 3. Digital technologies are a means, not an end. {#means-not-an-end}

Regenerate Bible believers have only one ultimate goal, which we might call an
end -- to love and glorify God, really two sides of one coin (Isaiah 43:6-7;
Ezekiel 36:22, 23, 32; Matthew 22:37; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Ephesians 1:5-6). Our
glorying and delight, then, should never terminate utterly in anything else.
When we glory in anything more than in God, we are functional idolators and
atheists.

For example, when I delight in my daughter's good behavior, my fascination and
my praise ought to be redirected through my daughter up to God. "God, thank you
that by Your grace, You have allowed and empowered my daughter to do this thing.
God, You are amazing for creating people who can exercise amazing skills. God,
if any good comes from my daughter, it comes from You for You are the source of
all goodness."

The same ought to be said of our use digital technology. Yet, we seem
particularly prone to make glowing screens the terminus of our delight, black
holes that absorb all our glorying and fascination within themselves.

* Rather than let a news headline drive me to prayer, it drives me to an isolated
fascination.
* Rather than let video games inspire intentional rest or humility or an
appreciation for God's skill worked out in impressive dexterity on a controller,
it inspires prideful, unchecked competitiveness, or a brain numbing escape from
reality, or rage.
* Rather than let a social media post increase the quality of my real, embodied,
  physical relationships, it lulls me into a false sense of one-way, unfounded
  belonging and social accomplishment.

Beware letting the arrow of your fascination hit your phone and disappear there.
Let the arrow hit that glossy screen and reflect upward to delighting in,
praying to, and walking with God.

## 4. It's okay to be different than everyone else. {#ok-to-be-different}

Just because the world says we *must* do things one way does not mean that we
have to do things that way. You don't have to be like the world. It is okay to
be "that guy" or "that gal" who is weird and different.

In fact, this reaction is expected. If you stand on Biblical convictions and
live those out in your use of digital technology, you will inevitably look
different than the world (Matthew 5:13-16; 2 Timothy 3:12; 1 Peter 2:19-21).

You may choose not to watch every show, or that one show you know contains
content that doesn't honor God. You may choose not to give your kids laptops or
smartphones at the same age as their peers. You may choose to arrange the spaces
and screens in your home differently than your unbelieving neighbors.

You don't need permission to do these things. And you're not alone doing them
either.
