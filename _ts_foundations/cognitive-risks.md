## Introduction  {#introduction}

You do not just act on digital technology. It also acts on you. The methods of
interaction that the technology allows (and doesn't allow), and the content you
see there all influence how you think and act.

Not all of these influences are positive, but the negative influences can be
mitigated or avoided altogether when you think carefully about how the
technology is influencing you and how you will actively choose to respond.

Each point below includes my recommendation for how to think about the risk in
order to mitigate it.

## Always-on entertainment makes you dumber  {#always-on-and-dumber}

Dumber as in less thoughtful. No silence. You need time for info to sink in,
which doesn't happen if you start the next episode. You forget stuff faster. You
have to check the weather or next GPS instruction 3 extra times.

## Short content, short attention spans  {#short-content}

Athletes can do exercises that optimize their physical muscles for quick bursts
of action or for prolonged, enduring effort. Any athlete can tell you that it's
not possible to optimize for both. A champion sprinter will not be able to
compete with a champion marathon runner, though they both excel with their legs,
heart, and lungs.

Your brain is a metaphorical muscle. And like physical muscles, your brain can
be trained for quick bursts of action or for prolonged, enduring effort, **but
not both simultaneously**.

Many digital technologies today pose the risk of training your brain for quick
bursts of action. YouTube users jump from video to video. News readers skim
headlines rather than read stories. Twitter users ingest full posts in under 10
seconds.

```
The average English word is 4.7 characters long.
The average tweet is 140 characters (or much shorter by some estimates).
Therefore, the approximate average tweet is 30 words long.

Estimated silent reading speed for non-fiction is 4 words per second.
Therefore, it takes a Twitter user approximately 7.5 seconds to read a tweet.
```

The simple act of using a technology that allows you to consume short content is
training your brain to effectively process massive volumes of small info nuggets
quickly. If you're an auction house auctioneer or an air traffic controller,
this might be a valuable skill.

For the rest of us, this brain-training comes at the cost of atrophy of our
skill in focusing deeply on a single thought, like what is required to
internalize a chapter in a textbook, or to follow the logic of a multi-part
argument in a book. 

If you've ever gotten brain-itchy and distracted while trying to focus on an
extended thought (like writing an email or reading a book), then you know the
problem here.

The solution is to be aware this is happening, and balance your brain's exercise
routine with more deep thinking, if not a majority of it.
