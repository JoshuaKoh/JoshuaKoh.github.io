You create a social media account. You post a picture of your three kids. The

You buy some pants online. On the merchant's site, you're asked if agree to
their cookies policy. Then you're asked if you want to make an account and save
a username and password. Then the merchant asks if you want it to save your
credit card. Then your web browser asks the same thing.

Do you know where cookies are stored? Do you know what cookies are? Do you know
where your username and password are stored? Your credit card info? Do you know
who can access that data, and when? Where does the data physically reside? Do
YOU know how to get access to it? What happens when you want to delete it?
