## Introduction  {#introduction}

No one speaks from a purely unbiased perspective. Every worldview has
presuppositions that it cannot prove in an absolute way and must assume are
true. These truths form the authority that all other theories, assertions, and
conclusions stand on.

Some people will claim they have no bias, or will try to hide or ignore their
biases. I think this is problematic at best and insidious at worst. Not
understanding someone's worldview can quickly lead to miscommunication and
antagonism.

So let me tell you my worldview up front, so that you know where I'm coming
from.

**My authority is the Bible.** I believe every claim it makes is true (John
17:17), because every word proceeds from the mouth of God who cannot lie (2
Timothy 3:16). I believe the Bible is wholly sufficient to inform morality and
healthy living for every aspect of life (2 Timothy 3:17), though we often need
wisdom to apply the Bible correctly (James 1:5).

Having a book as an authority comes with implications --

* If my worldview on a problem is found to contradict the Bible's view, I
  distort (refine) my thinking to align with the Bible, not distort (pollute)
  the Bible to align with my thinking.
* If the Bible speaks clearly about something, I confidently speak with
  confidence and definition.
* If the Bible does not speak clearly about something, I think it is best to
  understand the various perspectives. I work to be fully convinced in my own
  mind, but I also try to be flexible with others who have different
  interpretations (Romans 14:3-5).
