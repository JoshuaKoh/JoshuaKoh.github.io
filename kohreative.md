## About Koh-reative

Koh-reative is a project where I speak about topics that matter to me, in a free-form, creative audio format. If you know me well enough, you know I have a lot of thoughts and an endless willingness to share them with people. With my background in podcasting, I thought I might take advantage of my set-up to host my own talking corner. With the audio medium, I have the ability to host guests, add background music, or mix in sound effects. It's basically a personal creativity soapbox.

### Q. Is this for entertainment or education? 

That'll definitely depend on the topic and your own personal interests. I don't have any hesitations to speak about just about anything, so you can expect a variety.

### Q. How long will each episode be?

By duration, I'm shooting for about 10 minutes per recording, but that's just a loose guess. Some of these will be long, and some might be really short, and I don't feel bad about either. I'll try to communicate if one is unusual in length.

### Q. Should I expect the format to stay the same?

By pacing and tone, those will probably change significantly from one recording to the next. This is just my corner of creativity, so the look and feel of each audio will change depending on what mood I think fits best. You'll have to tune into each topic to see how I change things up!

### Q. What's your recording schedule?

By frequency, I might push these out one after another, and there might be some time between uploads. It'll be as creativity strikes me, as I think of things I want to share, and as I have time!

### Q. Can I give you feedback?

I'm extremely interested in getting feedback on what I make. What am I doing well or poorly? Can I make the recordings more conveniently available for you? Did you like what I said, or do you disagree with me?

I have a number of contact channels available above, and you can always reach out to me in person as well. Please let me know what you think!
