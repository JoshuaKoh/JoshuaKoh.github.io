Hello world! I'm a Google Cloud consultant-in-training at Google, former data science trained at Georgia Tech, and daily flesh fighter. ESTJ with feelings, gamer with rhythm, water with lemon.

I like board game-athons, hackathons, Python, pythons, pi, and pie.

This site is still under construction. I'll add more to this page Soon<sup>TM</sup>!
