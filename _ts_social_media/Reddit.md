## Description

Reddit can be accessed at [http://reddit.com](http://reddit.com).

Reddit is a community site where users submit links, text, images, and videos
which are then upvoted or downvoted by other users.

Reddit created their own digital, two-page "Reddit 101", which you can read
[here](https://www.redditinc.com/assets/press-resources/Reddit_101_1908.pdf).

Reddit is organized into community forums called "subreddits." Each subreddit
focuses on a particular topic. All user posts are added to one particular
subreddit. You can view subreddit posts sorted by new or by popular.

You can subscribe to subreddits that interest you. This populates your feed of
new or popular posts across all the subreddits you're subscribed to.

Subreddit topics vary greatly. Examples of popular generic subreddits include:

* "[aww](<https://www.reddit.com/r/aww>)", where users share cute videos and
  pictures
* "[news](<https://www.reddit.com/r/news>)", where users share news articles
* "[damnthatsinteresting](<https://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/>)",
  where users share random interesting facts (like this
  [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/uo61wm/this_mummy_sarcophagus_which_has_been_sealed_for/)
  of a 2,500 year old sarcophagus being opened for the first time)

Examples of specific subreddits include:

* "[minecraft](<https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/>)", where users can ask
  questions about the game or see news, screenshots, or ideas shared by other
  users
* "[gardening](<https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/>)", where users share
  guides, pictures, and discussions on all things related to plants and their
  care
* "[writingprompts](<https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/>)", where users
  share writing prompt ideas, or write short stories based on others' ideas and
  exchange feedback with other writers.

There really is a subreddit for every hobby and interest. You can get a sense of
the kinds of subreddits out there by skimming [the index of all
subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/a-1/). One of Reddit's [marketing
ideas](https://www.redditinc.com/) is that it has a community for anything.

Users can upvote or downvote individual posts, which sums to the post's score.

  <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}/tech-support/reddit-score.jpg" alt="Reddit score"/>
  <figcaption>Each Reddit post's score appears between its upvote and downvote
  arrows.</figcaption>
</figure>

Every Reddit account has an associated number called your "karma" count. If you
make a post, each upvote you get increases you account's "karma" count by 1.
This incentives users to make good posts, so that the posts get upvoted and your
total "karma" score goes up. "Karma" points don't do anything. They're just a
way to demonstrate that you are popular on the site.

</figure>

You can also comment on posts and reply to other people's comments. And, you can
upvote or downvote comments, which also gives "karma."

## Benefits

I think there are some legitimate reasons to use Reddit.

### Specialist communities

Reddit can be incredibly useful for folks with hobbies or specialized interests,
because there are subreddits dedicated to just about everything. Whether you're
into [baking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/),
[the yo-yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Throwers/), or
[backyard fruit trees](https://www.reddit.com/r/BackyardOrchard/), there is a
community with both amateurs and experts making interesting posts and willing to
help answer questions or celebrate wins.

I've used Reddit to ask and answer questions about Google Cloud Platform (my
line of professional work) and video games I play.

### Learning and entertainment

There's no denying that many of Reddit's subreddits are just fun to browse.
There are subreddits for philosopical debate, jokes, trickshot videos, art and
music of every medium and genre, dating advice, memes, memes about very specific
topics ([Lord of the Rings-only memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/), for
example), cute puppies, engineering projects, Marvel movies, ...and on and on.

This segways into one of the dangers of Reddit: [inappropriate
content](#inappropriate-content).

## Dangers

Here's my conclusion up front: Reddit can be a great tool if you have a specific
interest or use case that would benefit from the subreddit community, and if you
are a responsible, self-controlled user of the internet. But I would not
recommend Reddit ever for unrestrained use, random browsing, or for users who
struggle to independently stay safe online.

### Inappropriate content

Reddit *does allow* pornographic content. And vulgar content. And if you're
using an account, there is no way to filter these.

Each subreddit has moderators, and each subreddit has rules for what content is
allowed in that subreddit. Moderators can delete posts or comments that bully
others or infract on the subreddit's rules, but almost all subreddits allow
swearing and some crassness.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}/tech-support/reddit-rules.jpg" alt="Reddit rules"/>
  <figcaption>Example of the rules for the "soccer" subreddit. Notice that rule
  4 itself contains profanity.</figcaption>
</figure>

Posts deemed "not safe for work" (aka "nsfw") are required to have an "nsfw" tag
attached to the post. You can configure your account settings to initially block
"nsfw" pictures and videos, but all it takes is one click to dismiss the block.
In other words, Reddit's content filter is not effective for eliminating
inappropriate content.
`
<figure>
  <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}/tech-support/reddit-filter.jpg" alt="Reddit image filter"/>
  <figcaption>This is what the "nsfw" blocker looks like, but if you click the
  image, it un-blurs.</figcaption>
</figure>

It is possible to block access to particular subreddits, but it requires a
[Reddit Premium account](https://www.reddit.com/premium) ($6.99/mo at time of
writing). Furthermore, it's hardly possible to block every problematic subreddit
or post. Even if access control was free, there's always another derivative
subreddit with similar content to the one you just blocked.

If you aren't logged in, Reddit won't allow you to view "nsfw" content. It
prompts you to first create an account. This is one inhibitor to accidentally
seeing inappropriate content, and is the main way I use Reddit.

### Infinite content

Reddit users risk the foundational dangers of infinite content and infinite
scrolling. See [here]({{ site.url }}/tech-support/) for my explanation of these
dangers for this and many other
digital technologies.

### Internet points

This is a smaller danger by comparison.

## How they make money

### Advertisements

Reddit runs their own advertisements service, and ads appear as posts listed
among the normal content you browse. The ads look like other posts, but are
marked as advertisements.

### Subscriptions and "trophies"

## Conclusion

Reddit is a microcosm of the internet without restriction.
