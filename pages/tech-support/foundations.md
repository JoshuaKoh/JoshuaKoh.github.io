## Introduction  {#introduction}

Digital technology cannot be evaluated in a vacuum and is not morally neutral.
We are always acting on it, and often more importantly, it is always acting on
us. 

These "foundational" articles enumerate what I believe about how we use
digital technology, and how we *ought* to use it. These themes will recur in all
my writings about specific technologies, so I've centralized them here for your
reference and hopefully your benefit.

My goals with these articles are two-fold. One, that you would understand the
worldview and moral position that I am coming from, so that you can evaluate my
advice with the most clarity. Two, that you would be equipped to think more
deeply and critically about our use of technology, as you may not have
considered all these aspects before.

Good luck and happy thinking!
