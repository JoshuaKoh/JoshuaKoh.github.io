## Introduction  {#introduction}

No one speaks from a purely unbiased perspective. Every worldview has
foundational presuppositions that it cannot prove in an absolute way and must
assume are true. These truths form the authority that all other thoughts,
theories, and relative truths stand on.

Some people try to hide these biases or ignore them. I think this can lead to
frustration and miscommunication.

So let me tell you my authority up front, so that you know where I'm coming
from.

My authority is the Bible. I believe every claim it makes is true (John 17:17),
because every word proceeds from the mouth of God who cannot lie (2 Timothy
3:16). I believe the Bible is wholly sufficient to inform morality and wise
living for every aspect of life (2 Timothy 3:17).

This means --

* If my perspective on a problem is found to contradict the proper
  interpretation of the Bible, I distort my mind to align with the Bible, not
  distort the Bible to align with me.
* If the Bible speaks clearly about something, I have confidence to speak with
  confidence and definition.
* If the Bible does not speak clearly about something, I seek to understand the
  various perspectives. I work to be fully convinced in my own mind, but I also
  try to be flexible with others who have different interpretations
  (Romans 14:3-5).

This also means my presuppositions about how the Bible applies to digital
technology is also relevant. If you don't agree with my presuppositions, you
shouldn't value my recommendations.

## 1. Using digital technologies is an unavoidably moral act. {#unavoidably-moral}

God gives regenerate Bible believers one greatest commandment, one ultimate goal
-- to love and glorify God, really two sides of one coin (Isaiah 43:6-7; Ezekiel
36:22, 23, 32; Matthew 22:37; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Ephesians 1:5-6). We live
before the face of the only righteous Judge, and He evaluates whether
each of our acts is done in accord with this command (Matthew 12:36-37; Romans
14:12; Hebrews 4:13).

By implication, our lives and choices are inherently, unavoidably moral. Our
motives, thoughts, and deeds are either a pleasing aroma or a rebellious offense
to God.

This certainly includes our use of digital technology.

The unregenerate world will tell you that digital technology is neutral tool
with many uses that carry no consequences. "What harm or good can scrolling
Twitter do? It's just a thing you can do."

This is wrong. Digital technology, while not special in its morality, carries
important moral decisions in every act. It affects our stewardship of time. It
affects our social relationships, our wallets, and our purity. Every use of
digital technology is moral -- right or wrong.

If the stakes of our use of digital technology are as high as pleasing or
offending the almighty God, we should think carefully before and while we use
it.

## technologies

Everything we possess is given to us as gifts from God for the purpose of
stewarding and investing for His purposes. Further, He expects us to produce a
return on His investment (Matthew 25:14-30; Luke 12:42-46; 1 Corinthians 4:2; 1
Peter 4:10).

This certainly includes our use of digital technology.

The unregenerate world will tell you that you should use any product or service
of digital technology if you desire to, in any way you desire to, and that
everyone else is doing the same thing.

This is wrong. Just like spatulas, hammers, and chainsaws, digital
technologies are tools that:

* are created with certain uses in mind. E.g. a chainsaw was created to cut
  things mor easily than an axe.
* have proper and improper uses. E.g. a chainsaw can be used to clear a blocked
  road or to become a horror villain.
* take knowledge and awareness to use effectively. E.g. a chainsaw in the hands
  of a lumberjack performs much better than a chainsaw in *my* hands.

Imagine revving and swinging around a brand-new chainsaw, without knowing what
the switches do, how to turn it off, or who was around you. Imagine giving your
kid a chainsaw just because everyone else is doing it.

We should learn about various digital technologies before we use them, with the
same care that we read the operation manual for our new chainsaw before the
first rev. We should always use caution and thoughtfulness when wielding these
tools. And before giving them to others, we should make sure they are equipped
with knowledge to use them well, too.

## 3. Digital technologies are a means, not an end. {#means-not-an-end}

Regenerate Bible believers have only one ultimate goal, which we might call an
end -- to love and glorify God, really two sides of one coin (Isaiah 43:6-7;
Ezekiel 36:22, 23, 32; Matthew 22:37; 1 Corinthians 10:13; Ephesians 1:5-6) --
sound familiar? Our glorying and delight, then, should never terminate utterly
in anything else. To glory completely in anything but God is a form of
functional idolatry and atheism.

For example, when I delight in my daughter's good behavior, my fascination and
my praise ought to be redirected through my daughter up to God. "God, thank you
that by Your grace, You have allowed and empowered my daughter to do this thing.
God, You are amazing for creating people who can exercise amazing skills. God,
if any good comes from my daughter, it comes from You for only You are good."

The same should be said of our use digital technology. We seem particularly
prone to make glowing screens the terminus of our delight, black holes that
absorb all our glorying and fascination within themselves.

Rather than let a news headline drive me to prayer, it drives me to an isolated
fascination. Rather than let video games inspire intentional rest or humility or
an appreciation for God's skill worked out in impressive dexterity on a
controller, it inspires rage, a brain numbing escape from reality, or pride.

Beware letting the arrow of your fascination hit your phone and disappear there.
Let the arrow hit that glossy screen and reflect upward to delighting in,
praying to, and walking with God.

## 4. It's okay to be different than everyone else. {#ok-to-be-different}

Just because the world says we *must* do things one way does not mean that we
have to do things that way. You don't have to be like the world. It is okay to
be "that person" who is weird and different.

In fact, that's expected. If you stand on Biblical convictions and live those
out in your use of digital technology, you will inevitably look different than
those who don't (Matthew 5:13-16; 2 Timothy 3:12; 1 Peter 2:19-21).

You may choose not to watch every show, or that one show you know contains
content that doesn't honor God. You may choose not to give your kids laptops or
smartphones at the same age as their peers. You may choose to arrange the spaces
and screens in your home differently than your unbelieving neighbors.

You should know that you don't need permission to do these, and you're not alone
doing them either.
