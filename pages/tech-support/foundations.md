## Introduction  {#introduction}

Digital technology cannot be evaluated in a vacuum and is not morally neutral.
We are always acting on it, and often more importantly, it is always acting on
us.

These articles explain what I believe about how we use digital technology, and
how we *ought* to use it. These themes recur in my comments about specific
technologies, so I've centralized them here for your reference and hopefully
your benefit.

I have two goals for these articles.

1. That you would understand the worldview and moral position that I am coming
from, so that you can evaluate my advice with the most clarity.
1. That you would be equipped to think more deeply and critically about our use
of technology.

Good luck and happy thinking!
