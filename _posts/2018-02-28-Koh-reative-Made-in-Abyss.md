## Description

This is the first in probably three recordings I want to do on Made in Abyss. I've been wanting to share a resource for friends who've ben asking me what's so great about this show. 

In the future, I'll talk about the music of Made in Abyss and also how it realizes its potential. There's less of each of those in this recording, however.

## Text Notes

Made in Abyss is an anime that aired in late 2017, and boy was it good. It tells a simple story in really beautiful ways. Today, I want to talk about how it captivated me. If you’ve seen it, I’m sure you’d agree and I’d love to compare notes with you. And if you haven’t seen it, then consider this entire recording your invitation to check it out. It was my favorite show of 2017, and it seems the majority of the anime community agrees, with Made in Abyss winning best anime of 2017 in the Crunchyroll Anime Awards. I’d strongly recommend you go watch the story unspoiled, but I’ll be giving little hints here. If you’re like me and hate to be spoiled in any way, just take me at my recommendation and go watch it. When was the last time I offered a genuine recommendation and let you down? 

Ok before I get into any real convincing, here’s a short summary. Made in Abyss tells the story of Riko, an 12 -year old girl who, with her friend Reg, descends the Abyss. The Abyss is a giant hole in the ground with no known depth. It is filled with fantastic and valuable treasures, or Relics, as well as imaginative creatures and worlds. It’s also dangerous, and explorers train in order to survive deeper dives before returning to the surface. The Abyss is also cursed, such that the deeper you go, the heavier the toll when you ascend back to the surface. 

And that’s it! It’s the story of Riko and Reg’s descent down a dangerous, unexplored chasm in the Earth. Good question to ask when you hear a setting summary: what kinds of potential does this story have? Where might it go, and what might happen? In this case, the story elements you’d expect are all there. Encounters with dangerous creatures, meeting experienced explores who’ve seen some stuff - living in the Abyss, and the perils of the curse. And yet it’s told in such a captivating way. Stay with me, I want you to hear a few things. These are the four ways that Made in Abyss stole my heart with its storytelling.

One, Made in Abyss’s storytelling has the perfect tone. This is by far my longest point, but I want to clarify when I said simple story. Don’t get me wrong here, Made in Abyss is not a boring story. You probably know me. I’m no sucker for simple kids’ stories. This isn’t, “Oh no, there’s a big scary monster! But by the power of teamwork, we’ll defeat it together! Hiyah! Wow, I’m so glad our relationship has strengthened. Let’s go on to the next level.” 

Made in Abyss is real and it’s raw and it’s beautiful. It realizes its potential of sending children into a death hole by giving measured doses of despair. There’s a constant contrast between cheeriness and crippling darkness. The story wastes no time convincing you of the innocence and child-like nature of these characters. Wide-eyed wonder, snot trails, poop jokes, and an orphanage. I get it, they’re kids. Unfortunately these days, anime that wants to communicate that the characters who appear grade-school age are in fact grade-school age and not high school students have to do a little extra work, and this story does a good job of that. But at the same time, the author gets that if he’s going to call the Abyss a dangerous, unexplored, lethal place, and if two children are going to enter with the intent of descending to its bottom, there will be dire dangers and consequences, and there certainly are! That’s what I love about the story. It gets dark, it gets really dark. And by darkness, I mean depression, blood, torture, violence. But it’s all darkness that fits within the framework of the story! If, by a character’s try-hard attitude, they choose to fight an advanced poisonous beast, you’re probably going to get hurt. And if you get hurt, you’re going to die of poison unless you do something, like cut off your arm! And yeah, that’s all from one episode of the show. The characters motivate the encounters and the consequences, and the consequences reflect back on the characters, who change and grow. It’s clever and creative story telling. The show’s title itself is a double or triple entendre, depending on how you count, which is just genius. If you like cheery settings, you’ll get it. And if you like intensity or depression, you’ll get that too, and at an adult level, not a 10-year old level. It’s not rated R-17 for no reason.

Ok, moving along faster now, second way Made in Abyss captured me. The art. As an audio recording, I regret I can’t show anything off, but you should start looking once you watch the first episode. The characters are designed simply but with particular details that bring them to life. But more so, all of the backgrounds and settings are just stunning. Just realizing that someone actually drew all those by hand, wow! Yeah, they’ll add CG effects in post, but the base drawings are organic. And it’s a constant art gallery as the characters move from setting to fantastic setting. From the populous town on the surface to the lush First Layer to the upside down forest or the Great Fault sheer rock face, there’s plenty of time to look at all sorts of creative and pretty things. Here too, the series realizes its potential as a fantasy world by letting you enjoy looking at fantastical things. If you give it a watch or rewatch, remember to be on the look out when the characters are walking through the slums in episode 3. Thousands of ropes and wood boards all drawn and colored. It’s amazing, and I love to take time to appreciate real talent on display. The art director Osamu Masuyama was one of the artists for Madoka Magica as well as the movie Your Name, both of which cannot be mentioned without talking about their equally beautiful art. The detail and color just drew me in, and it was a joy to watch.

 Third way, the voice acting. In a visual medium like TV shows, if you’ve got good visuals combined with good voice acting to tell a good story, you’ve got something that will at the very least grab attention. The Monogatari series has more proof of that for you, if you need it. And Made in Abyss also has all three. From the little tonalities that really sell a conversation, to the little ouchies and groans they make after taking a tumble, they’re almost always on point. Especially in the later episodes where things start getting really messy, the passion in the voice acting really comes out strong. I love to be on the lookout for good acting, because it’s a talent I don’t possess and one that I recognize takes a lot of skill. Until you’ve tried crying out like you’re bleeding out of every orifice or watching your best friend be tortured to death in front of you, don’t diss the people who try. Fortunately, you don’t have to worry about that with Made in Abyss, because they don’t just try. They do it and they sell it and it’s awesome!

(Remembering Home) And finally, the last way that Made in Abyss totally captured me, is the music. All of the music from this recording is straight from the soundtrack, and it’s composer Kevin Penkin’s greatest work to date, in my opinion. There’s beauty and variety, and there’s so many little cool aspects about it that I want to dedicate an entire recording just to talking about what few things it did poorly and how awesome it is that the soundtrack uses motifs through, not melodies but instruments. From the pounding intense parts (Forces Beyond Control) to the token synthwavey song (Discover the Abyss) to the array of beautiful orchestral pieces, this is a soundtrack that adds so much to the world and stands on its own as an incredible achievement in music and an example of how to do soundtracks right!
