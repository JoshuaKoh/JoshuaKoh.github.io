## About Koh-reative

If you know me well enough, you know I have a lot of thoughts and an endless willingness to share them with people. With my background in podcasting, I thought I might take advantage of my set-up to host my own talking corner, for speaking about topics that matter to me. Yeah, it's basically a personal soapbox.

Is this for entertainment or for education? That'll definitely depend on the topic and your own personal interests. I don't have any hesitations to speak about just about anything, so you can expect a variety. 

Some of these will be long in duration, and some might be really short. I'm shooting for about 10 minutes per recording, but that's just a loose guess. The pacing might be completely different from one recording to the next. They might come out one after another, and there might be some time between uploads. This is just my corner of creativity, and I appreciate you taking interest!

I'll always post whatever notes I used to produce the recording here on the site, below the audio. All of my text content and recordings are protected by Creative Commons, and you can see my terms [here](www.blog.joshuakoh.me/cc).

Thanks for listening!

## Contact

I'm extremely interested in getting feedback on what I make. What am I doing well or poorly? Can I make the recordings more conveniently available for you? Did you like what I said, or do you disagree with me?

I have a number of contact channels available above, and you can always reach out to me in person as well. Please let me know what you think!
