## Project Idea

I'd like to work on a simulation focused on [Lean thinking](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/)! I'd like to build a simulation of a **manufacturing plant floor**. I want to apply various techniques of Lean thinking to a plant line and observe how those changes affect production throughput. We could simulate a stream of widgets moving through the floor while...

- controlling or limiting WIP into the system
- protecting or exposing a constraint
- implementing or removing takt time
- any number of other Lean ideas

There is lots of literature on this subject (e.g. papers from the Winter Simulation conference) already out there for us to build on!

## About Me

Programming languages (in approximate descending order of strength):

- Python
- Scala
- Java
- C

Logistic details:

- 4th year Computer Science undergrad, taking the class as CX 4230.
- Background in data science. 
- Living on West Campus
- Some availability windows:
    - After 3:30pm on Tues, Thurs
    - Most of the day Fri, Sat, Sun
    - More times! Going into any more detail here would be a pain for you to read and me to write. 

Please [reach out to me](mailto:joshuakoh@gatech.edu) if you're interested. I'd love to discuss more and am open to pivoting my initial idea according to your thoughts.
