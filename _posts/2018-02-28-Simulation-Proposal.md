## Current Team

We've got a full team now! Will add new links if/when we post code or results of our simulation. Exciting!

## Project Idea

I'd like to work on a simulation focused on [Lean thinking](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/)! I'd like to build a simulation of a **manufacturing plant floor**. I want to apply various techniques of Lean thinking to a plant line and observe how those changes affect production throughput. We could simulate a stream of widgets moving through the floor while...

- controlling or limiting work-in-progress (WIP) into the system. Lean expects that when input and output rates are matching, there is much less WIP in the system overall. In contrast, when orders are input into the system without restraint, WIP should build up in the system and take up space.
- protecting or exposing a constraint. Lean expects that when you allow your most productive resource to be distracted by side tasks such as repairing a broken system, output is low. In contrast, if you protect your most productive resource from distractions, even if slower units are used to repair the broken system, you output at a higher rate.
- implementing or removing [takt time](https://www.lean.org/lexicon/takt-time).
- any number of other Lean ideas!

There is lots of literature on this subject (e.g. papers from the Winter Simulation conference) already out there for us to build on!

## About Me

Programming languages (in approximate descending order of strength):

- Python
- Scala
- Java
- C

Logistic details:

- 4th year Computer Science undergrad, taking the class as CX 4230.
- Background in data science. 
- Living on West Campus
- Some availability windows:
    - After 3:30pm on Tues, Thurs
    - Most of the day Fri, Sat, Sun
    - More times! Going into any more detail here would be a pain for you to read and me to write. 

Please [reach out to me](mailto:joshuakoh@gatech.edu) if you're interested in learning more about what we're working on. Our team is currently full and we're not looking for new members, sorry!
