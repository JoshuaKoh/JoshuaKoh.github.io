## Description

Reddit can be accessed at [http://reddit.com](http://reddit.com).

Reddit is a community site where users submit links, text, images, and videos
which are then upvoted or downvoted by other users. 

Reddit is organized into "subreddits" which are forums focused on particular
topics. Exampels of popular subreddits include "aww" for cute videos and pics,
"news" for news, and "damnthatsinteresting" for random interesting facts. But
there are miche subreddits for every hobby and interest, including
"woodworking", "streetwear", and "redstone" (the collectable material in
Minecraft that allows you to program machines in the game). Reddit 
[prides itself](https://www.redditinc.com/) in having a community for anything.

All user posts are added to one particular subreddit. You can view
subreddit posts sorted by new or by popular, or you can subscribe to
subreddits that interest you then get a feed of new or popular posts across all
your subreddits. 

You can upvote or downvote individual posts. Highly upvoted posts end up in the
subreddit's list of popular posts. You can also comment on posts and reply to
other people's comments. 

Reddit created their own digital, two-page "Reddit 101", which you can read
[here](https://www.redditinc.com/assets/press-resources/Reddit_101_1908.pdf).

## Benefits

### Specialist communities

Reddit can be useful for folks with hobbies or other specialized interests,
because there are subreddits dedicated to just about everything. Whether you're
into [baking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/), 
[the yo-yo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Throwers/), or 
[backyard fruit trees](https://www.reddit.com/r/BackyardOrchard/), there is a
community with both amateurs and experts making interesting posts and willing to
help answer questions or celebrate wins. 

When I used it, Reddit kept me updated on the news related to my hobbies (e.g.
new character added to X video game!) and enabled me to both ask and answer
questions. People are typically decent when responding to a well-written
question.

### Learning and entertainment

"Oh that's neat!" is a common thought when browsing Reddit. 

## Dangers

todo

### Secular language

Names of subreddits.

Commenter quality.

### Infinite content

Infinite scroll. Waste of time.

### Inappropriate content

Reddit *does allow* pornographic content.

NSFW filter is limited. Use logged out?

### Internet points

This is a smaller danger by comparison. 

## How they make money

### Advertisements

Reddit runs their own advertisements service, and ads appear as posts listed
among the normal content you browse. The ads look like other posts, but are
marked as advertisements.

### Subscriptions and "trophies"

## Conclusion

Reddit is a microcosm of the internet without restriction.
